# AirBnB Full-Stack Clone

This is a full-stack clone of the popular accommodation booking platform AirBnB. The aim of this project is to replicate core functionalities of the real platform by building a fully functional web application that enables users to:

- Browse and search for property listings
- View detailed information about each property
- Create and manage listings (for hosts)
- Book available properties
